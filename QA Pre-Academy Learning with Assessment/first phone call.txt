Motivates you to work in IT

It's hard to avoid technology even if you want to and as it's the future I find it important to stay up to date
Working in IT is obviously one of the greatest ways to do this and ha had me interested from a young age - 
	tinkering with computers etc
While I wasn't able to take a computing course at school I decided to do a (funnily enough) QA Apprenticeship post A-levels
This has definitely helped me get  astep into the field and with almost 5 years of experience now I can safely say I love it
I even went to uni (albeit only for a year) after my apprenticeship to learn more however I don't believe the format suited me
I love studying and consolidating what I know while working - I even spend time outside of work learning new things that will
help me for example with my current job I have been working on some Window server courses to help me and my team at work.


As I have done a QA scheme before I have an idea of what it will entail as well as knowing how effective it was for me and the
way that I learn - I really appreciate the company and know that they care, the support they give is incredible and I'm 
confident that anyone that get's onto one of their courses is pushed to to be succesful rather than just being another number
I'm looking to progress my career and while I do studying in my own time I know there isn't any room to grow at my current
workplace while this program puts gets you the skills needed for a job at a top company which I imagine has great room for
progression. I want to be able to be the best version of myself by learning new skills not ony for myself but for the company
I'm working for too.
