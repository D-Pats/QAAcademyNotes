Nested Queries
	Overview
		A type of MySQL command that allows you to query info that has been returned from another query
		
		this involves excapulation or 'wrapping' a SELECT statement within another one
		
		EXAMPLE
			SELECT customer_id, forename, city
			FROM customers
			WHERE customer_id=(
				SELECT customer_id
				FROM orders
				WHERE order_id=1
			);
			
				This will show the customer_id, forename, and city fields from the customer table WHERE
				The customer_id in the orders table has the order_id of 1
		
	
	Views
		It is common practice to use a view within a database to 'save' the results of a query
		
		A view acts very similarly to a table, with a key difference. A table is dynamic, a view is a snapshot.
			If you update the table the view is created from the view will not change alongside the table. It stays the same.
		
		EXAMPLE: 
			CREATE VIEW result_of_encapsulated_query
			AS
				SELECT customer_id
				FROM orders
				WHERE order_id=1
			;
			
			You can do a select from the view to get results
			

Data Normalisation
	Normalisation is the process of modelling the way a database might look by designing its schema
	
	Normal Forms
		First Normal Form (1NF)
		Second Normal Form (2NF)
		Third Normal Form (3NF)
		
			Each form iterates over the other - a 2NF table will always also conform to 1NF, 3NF will always confirm to 2NF and 1NF
			
		
		First Normal Form
			Each column should only contain a single value
			Values stored in a column should all be of the same type
			All columns in a table should have unique names
			The data should not be stored in any particular order
		
		
		Second Normal Form
			2NF asserts that tables should not contain partial dependencies
				Should not have duplicate from another table, must only have the FK not FK and another field from FK table
			
		
		Third Normal Form
			3NF requires that out tables do not have any transitive dependencies.
				A transitive dependency is a non-key dependency - if one column depends on another and neither areprimary keys then it is transitive
				
	
Entity-Relationship Diagrams
	Overview
		ERD is a type of abstract data model
		When using context of a database, and ERD allows you to map out the relationships between your tables
	
	
	Concept
		Generally used at the beginning of a project when designing the structure of the tables involved
		
		They allow you to clearly see how every piece of data you store in your database will relate to every other piece of data
		
		Common questions which arise
			What data will the database be storing
			Who will be accessing the system
			What will the data be used for
		
		
		ERDs can be made irrespective of whether you
			already have data to model
			don't have any data to begin with at all
		
	
	Design
		Chen
			A conceptual model named after the creator of ERD
		
		UML
			A logical model using Unified Modelling Language standard - also commonly used for class diagrams
	
	
		Typical components
			entity types
				in a relational database this would be our tables
			
			relationships
				the way that each entity links to each other (represented by our primary and foreign keys)
			
			attributes
				the way that an entity can be described (e.g. columns in our table)
			
	
	Entity Types & Entities
		
		Entities 
			are objects which can store information - such as a customer, an order, or a product
		
		Entity Types
			are classes of objects, and a re plural - such as customers, orders, or products - these are our tables
		
	
	Attributes
		An attribute is a property of an entity or something that can be used to describe an entity
	
		Ways to represent attributes
			Simple
				an attribute which cannot be split down, such as a forename
			
			Composite
				an attribute which can be split down, such as a name a forename, middle names, and surname
			
			Derived
				an attribute which is determinded by another attribute, such as an age which is determined by a date of birth
				
			Attributes can be single-value or multi-value
				home phone number and work phone number fields would both be single-value
				a phone number field which is captured twice would be multi-value
		
	
	Roles
		Roles are written in natural language to explain the nature of a relationship

	Many-to-many relationships with MySQL
		Man to many relationships when multiple fields in one table are associated with multiple fields in another table
			For example, a student can enrol in multiple classes and a class can include multiple student
		
		MySQL does not support direct many-to-many relationships between tables
			You will need to create a third table called a "middleman", "child table", or "join table"
			
			It is possible to split a many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships
