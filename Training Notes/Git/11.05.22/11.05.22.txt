Branching
	Intro
		Branching lets ud define workflows
		Allows us to deliver code in the best possible state
		Minimises the risk of bugs and errors
	
		With version control systems like Git we can create as many different branches as we want, allowing us to isolate development and testing from code that is known to work

	
	Feature-Branch Model
		The develop or dev branch is at the same point or ahead of the master or main branch
		
		Need to push branches to remote to appear in the remote
		
		Create a branch
			git branch <new branch name>
			
			git checkout -b <new branch name>
				this creates branch and checksout to the branch
			
		
		Create branch on remote
			Checkout branch to push
				git push -u <remote name> <branch name>
			
		
		Show branches
			git branch
				the * next to a branch means you are on this branch
				
		
		Switch branch
			git branch <branch name>
		
		
		Delete a branch
			Can't delete a branch you are currently in (checked out)
			
			git branch -d <branch name>
			
			Delete on remote
				git push --delete origin <branch name>
				
	
	Merging
		Intro
			What is merging?
				Merging joins the HISTORY of branches together
				Any changes in one branch are reflected in another
			
			Example
				
				
				feature-1  	 E---F---G
							/
				main 	A---B---C---D
				
			
			You merge INTO the branch you have currently checked out
				git checkout main
				git merge feature-1
				
				feature-1  	 E---F---G
							/          \
				main 	A---B---C---D---H
			
	
	Merging Conflicts
		When merging you can encounter conflicts
		These happen when:
			more than one person has edited the same line in a file
			if a  line that was in use has been removed
			if a file that is in use has been deleted
		
		The conflict ONLY affects the person doing the merge
		
		If a merge conflict occurs...Git will:
			Pause the merge
			show the files that are conflicting
			ask the developer to resolve the conflict
			then complete the merge


Creating a Pull Request
	
	From a Branch within a repository
		Create a feature branch and push it to VCS
			Clone a repository done with git clone <SSH Key>
			Create and switch to new branch using git checkout -b <branch name>
			Make changes to the feature branch and git add then git commit
			Push the feature branch up using git push origin <branch name>
			new branch should now be reflected in your VCS
			
		Create a Pull Request
			Go to repo you're working with and click 'Compare and pull request'
			You will need to choose which branch you want the changes to eventually be on and which branch the changes are currently on
			Add a title and some comments
			Configure any additional options
			Click 'Create pull request'
	
	From a Forked Repo
		Create a Pull Request
			Ensure you have a forked repo, and have made some changes
			Navigate to the repo you created the fork from
			Click on New pull request
			Amend your base and compare to relect to correct branches
			Click on 'compare accross forks'
			Confirm that the base fork is the repo you'd like to merge into
				use the base drop-down menu to select the branch of the repo you'd like to merge into
			Use the head fork drop-down to select your forked repo, then use the compare to select the branch you made your changes in
			Insert title and description for your pull requestConfigure any other options
			Click 'Create Pull Request'
			
			This can then be reviewed by the product owner and other collaborators and merged into the base branch
