NodeJS
	Overview
		In Node each JS file is its own module. These modules are decrete collections of javascript that are kept separate in order to reduce coupling and increase cohesion
		
	
	Exporting modules (module.exports)
		now.js // some file name
			const now = new Date()l
			
			module.exports.startDate = now;
			
	
	Importing modules (require() function)
		index.js //some file name
			const { startDate } = require('./now.js');
			
			console.log(startDate);
			
		
		Importing from node_modules is just as easy - simply omit the ./
		
		const chalk = require('chalk');
