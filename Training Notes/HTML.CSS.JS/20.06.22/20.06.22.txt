Java is SERVER side
	Any request should first travel over a network and go to a SERVER machine
	Server computes your request and tranlates to a SOLUTION
	SOLUTION travels back to the source

Why Move away from Server side?
	Resuability! images, buttons, text -> repeatedly used -> Pointless and waste of network to send same data back and forth


HTML
	When you create a HTML file, always open with a HTML tag
		Close a tag as soon as you open it to avoid confusion
			Open Tag
				<html>
			Close Tag
				</html>


	Example of a file with tags
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>Sample Text - goes into the tab name</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				<p> Sample Text for Para</p>
				<button onclick='randomFunction();'> Sample text for button </button>
				
				<script>
					function randomFunction() {
						alert('Alert message');
					}
				</script>
			</body>
		</html>
