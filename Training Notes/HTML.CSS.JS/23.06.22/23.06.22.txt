HTML
	Intro
		start with:
			<html>
				<head>
				</head>
				<body>
				</body>
			</html>
			
	DTD
		<!doctype html>
			This was required before the <html> tag
			Browsers now assume this tag and is not now required
			
	
	HTML defines the site
	CSS visualises it
	JavaScript manipulates the tree of content
	
	HEAD
		tags include
			<title>
				defines title of document for the browser tab (favourites and search engines)
			<style>
				defines style info about the document (can also be done by css)
			<link>
				defines where external style sheets should be linked from
			<meta>
				specifies the page's character set, description, keywords, author, viewport, etc.
			<script>
				defines the client-side JavaScript (more commonly at the bottom of the <body> tag to load the page content quicker)
			<base>
				specifies base URL and taget for all relative URLs in a page
		
		Title and Meta are ALWAYS in the head tag, the others can be part of other tags like body too.
	

Entities
	characters used for markup cannot be used for other things like mathematical computation, we use entities instead, they also have entity numbers
	common ones:
		< is &lt;
			less than
		> is &gt;
			greater than
		& is &amp;
		" is &quot
		' is &apos
		non-breaking space is &nbsp;
		Â£ is &pound
		bullet points is &bullet;
