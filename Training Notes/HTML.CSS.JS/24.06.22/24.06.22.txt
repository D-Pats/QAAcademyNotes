Variables
	Using ES6 standard
		we use  let and const to declare variables


ASI
	semi colon breaks up the code (lines don't matter - code is read until ; then runs)


Strict mode
	strict means follow our code exactly
	loose mode is defrault and our browser will fix errors that it is set to do (such as auto closing tags)


Iteration
	similar to java but instad of "data type variable" it is "let variable"
		example
			for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {console.log(i)}
				is now
			for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {console.log(i)}


Coditionals
	if, else, else if
		similar to java
	

OOP
	has classes and constructors like in Java
