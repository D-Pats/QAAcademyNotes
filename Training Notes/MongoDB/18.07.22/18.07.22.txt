Mongo DB
	Overview
		It's a document store (non-relational database)
		
	
	Data Format
		An entry in the database (document) represents a whole object
		
		Documents are stored as BSON - key value pairs
		
		{
			"id" : ObjectID("dfasasfdas"),
			"firstName" : "Devin",
			"lastName" : "Patel"
		}
		{
			"id" : ObjectID("dfasasfdas1"),
			"firstName" : "Jordan",
			"lastName" : "Benbelaid"
		}
	
	
	Why is it used?
		Less restricitve as it doesn't follow a pre-set schema
		scalable through sharding
		
	
	When should it be used?
		When your data has no fixed structure
		When there is no strong relationships between different collections
		

Databases
	Create
		use db_name
		
		
	Read
		show dbs
			to find the name of the currently selected db it can be accessed via the variable: db
		
		
	Update https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/#std-label-mongodump-example-copy-clone-database
		Use mongodump and mongorestore - have to do this outside of mongo (exit mongo then do it)
			Oneline
				mongodump --archive --db=old_db | mongorestore --archive  --nsFrom='old_db.*' --nsTo='new_db.*'
				
			Two lines
				mongodump --archive="backup_file" --db=old_db
				mongorestore --archive="backup_file" --nsFrom='old_db.*' --nsTo='new_db.*'
				
				
			Depricated way
				No way to rename in MongoDB
					copy the db, give it a new name then remove the old one
						old_name.copyDatabase('old_name', 'new_name');
						use old_name
						old_name.dropDatabase();
				
				
	Delete
		Delete a database by using it then dropping
			use db_name
			db.dropDatabase();
			

Collections
	Overview
		A collection is a group of documents
		Collections enforce no schema, they do not have to follow the same structure
		Generally documents in a schema will be related but don't have to follow a set structure
	
	
	Create
		.createCollection()
		db.createCollection('collection_name')
		
		it is also possible to insert a socument into a collection that does not exist yet and will then create the collection
		
		It's possible to pass in an options object as an optional second argument
		This allows for the setting of a max memory amount or enforcing validation on documents to be added to the collection
		
	
	Read
		show collections
			This will display all collections in the current database
			
	
	Update
		.renameCollection()
		db.collection_name.renameCollection('new_name')
		
	
	Delete
		.drop()
		db.collection_name.drop()
