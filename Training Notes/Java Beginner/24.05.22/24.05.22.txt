Arrays
	Overview
		Stores many values in a single variable
		Arrays are designed to hold data collections, can be single or multi-dimensional, and work with indexes and elements
		Each value in an array is referred to as an element and that element is indexed
		The index is used as a point of reference ofr an element, the index starts at 0
	
	Creating an Array
		Single-Dimensional Array
			public int[] arrayName;
				Above is an empty array
			
			public int[] arrayName = {25, 43, 23, 46, 30};
				Above is an example of adding data into the array
			
			public int[] arrayName = new int[5];
				This creates an empty array with the length of 5 indexes in the array.
					no more than the specified length can be stored in this array
					can assign into it with arrayName[index number] = value;
		
		Multi-Dimensional Array
			public int[][] arrayName;
				This creates an empty multi dimensional array
			
			public int[][] arrayName = {{25,30,21},{56,67,39},{8}};
				This creates an array with data in it
					the [][] indicates multi-dimensional and will only ever need 2 sets of square brackets no matter how many arrays in it
				
				public int [][] arrayName = new int[3][2];
					Creates an empy array with a specified length
						[3] shows it can have 3 arrays
						[2] shows each array can have 2 values in them
						
		
	Assigning Array Values
		arrayName[index number] = value;
			Single dimensional
		
		arrayName[index number of array][index number in array] = value'
			Multi dimensional
