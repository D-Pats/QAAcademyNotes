Type Casting
	Overview
		Type casting is the act of changing a variable or other entity to another date type(int,float,double,etc.)
	
	
	Widening
		Smaller to larger
			byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
			
		Example
			public class MyClass {
			  public static void main(String[] args) {
				int myInt = 9;
				double myDouble = myInt;
			  }
			}
	
	
	Narrowing
		Large to small
			double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

		Example
			public class MyClass {
			  public static void main(String[] args) {
				double myDouble = 9.78;
				int myInt = (int) myDouble;
			  }
			}
			

Final
	Overview
		The final keyword is used in different contexts
		
		Can be used in the context of a variable, a method, or a class
		
		When the final keyword is used with a variable, you can no longer change the value of that variable
		
		When the final keyword is applied to a class you will no longer be able to extend that class
		
	
	Final Variable
		We generally apply the final keyword to a variable when we have an attribute of a class that will have the same value across all instances of that class.
		We can declare a variable and apply the final keyword to it in the following way:
		
		public class FinalKeyword {
			
			private final int num = 3;
		
		}
		
		public class FinalKeyword {
			
			public final void method() {
			
			}
		}
		
		public final class FinalKeyword {
		
		}
		

Static
	Overview
		Static is a keyword that indicates that the member belongs to the type itself, rather than to an instance of an object
	
		This means that only one instance of the static member is created, and is then shared between each instance of the class
	

Scanner
	Overview
		Using the Scanner class in the java.util package we can get an input from the user
	
	The Scanner has different methods for user input and allows us to specify the type of variable we want to get.
		List of some methods below: 
			next()			Reads a String value from the user, but only the first word of the line
			nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean value from the user
			nextByte()		Reads a byte value from the user
			nextDouble()	Reads a double value from the user
			nextFloat()		Reads a float value from the user
			nextInt()		Reads an int value from the user
			nextLine()		Reads a String value from the user
			nextLong()		Reads a long value from the user
			nextShort()		Reads a short value from the user

		Example
			import java.util.Scanner;

			public class InputWithScanner {

				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
					System.out.println("Enter your username");

					String user = scan.nextLine();
				}
			}
