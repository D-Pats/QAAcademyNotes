HashSets
	Overview
		HashSets are a type of collection in Java
		
		A HashSet works by storing information through hashing
		Every object stored inside a HashSet has its own unique hash code
			this means duplicate values are not allowed
		
		The hash code is then used as the index for the value of the daa stored
		
		this means that every hashSet is backed by its own HashMap
			the hash code is stored as the key
			the actual object you're storing in the HashSet is used as the value
	
	
	HashSets in action
	
		Instantiation
			public class HashSetsExample {
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
				}
			}
			
		
		add()
			hashSet.add("A");
			hashSet.add("B");
			system.out.println(hashSet);
