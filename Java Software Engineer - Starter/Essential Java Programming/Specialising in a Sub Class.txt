Extending a Class
	A class may extend the definition of another class
		Methods and instance data of the superclass are available to the subclass (based on superclass method/field visibility)
		New instance data can be added
		New methods can be added
	
	Subclassing is expressed using the extends keyword
		public class Person {
			private String name;
			public void speak() {
				System.out.println("Hello my name is @+ name);
			}
			...
		}
		
		public class Employee extends Person{
			private int employeeId;
			public void work() {
				System.out.println("Employee ID: "+ employeeId);
			}
			...
		}


Overriding a method in a subclass
	Subclass can override methods of the superclass
		Same name, return type, and calling parameters
		Different behaviour
		Best practice is to always use the @Override annotation
			this is not required but it helps the compiler (and programmers) detect errors
