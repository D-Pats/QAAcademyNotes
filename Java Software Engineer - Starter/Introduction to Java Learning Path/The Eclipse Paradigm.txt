What is Eclipse
	Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) written in Java
		Every year, ther has been a major release of Eclipse
	
	Eclipse is tightly coupled to Java since it is written in Java and is primarily focused on Java development
	
	Starting with Java 9, there is a faster cadence for Java releases
		This has led to a faster release cadence for Eclipse
			Feature releases every 6 months
			Update releases every quarter
			Long-term support releases every 3 years
	

Workspace and Workbench
	Eclipse provides two main conceptual levels for application development
		Workspace
			physical location of projects, packages, files, etc.
		
		Workbench
			perspectives, editors, and views
		
	The Workbench provides conceptually organised tools to work with the actual resources in your Workspace
	

File and Workspace Locations
	You can organise your files as you would like
		Might consider placing development resources together in path that is close to root
			EXAMPLES
			C:\Development\Tools
			C:\Development\Applications
	
	Ensure path to workspaces have no spaces
		EXAMPLE
			C:\Development\Workspaces
		
	Often organise workspaces by major projects
		Ensure clean, well-seperated development environments


Workspace Management
	Can switch workspaces from within Eclipse
		(File -> Switch Workspace)
			
	Workspace synchronise with file system reliably
	

Workbench: A Closer Look
	Package Explorer View
	Java Editor
	Task List View
	Outline View
	Problem View


Workbench Details
	The Eclipse Workbench provides three main visual tools to facilitate development
		Perpectives
			A group of views and editors appropriate for a specific task such as debugging a Java application
		
		Editors
			A component that developers can use to create and modify files
		
		Views
			A component that provides information (metadata) about a selected resource
		

Views
	Each Perpective provides certain Views
	
	Each view shows something of interest to that perspective
	
	Multiple views can be arranged t be visible at the same time in the Workbench Window
	
	Common Views often used
		Package Explorer
		Outline
		Properties
		Problems
		Tasks
		Bookmarks


Navigator View
	Shows how different resources are structured
	
	There are three kinds of resources
		Files
		Folders
		Projects
	

Outline View
	An overview of the key elements that make up the resource that is being edited
	
	Allows quick and easy navigation through your resource using a tree model for organising related elements


Property View
	When you click on a resource in the navigator view and then click on the properties tab on the bottom of the screen, you can view the properties of that resource


Task List View
	The Task List View contains a list of task items
		You can manually add tasks yourself
			EXAMPLE
				You can add a task which reminds you that you have to implement a Java method
			
		You can set up several filters to show only the taks you really want to see
	

Problems View
	The Problems view contains a list of problems
		Tool determined issues (errors)
		Automatically added to the Problems View
		Double-clicking on an entry will take you to the location of the problem
		Right clicking on the icon (left side) will provide you with option for Quick Fix


Compiler Errors
	Coding (Compiler) errors will be shown while coding


Editors
	Double-clicking on a resource opens the associated editor
	
	XML, Text, Source Code Editors and others


Perspectives
	Perpectives are a way to look at different facets of a project
	
	The Workbench window can have several perspectives opened but only one of them is visible at a time
	
	Perspectives Match to Roles or Tasks
		Java developer - Java Perspective
		Debugging - Debug Perspective
		Collaboration - Team Synchronising Perspective
		XML - XML Perspective
		

Customising Perspectives
	Views can be moved and added to perspective
		Double-click on the title bar to maximise the view
		Moving views to other panes or stacking them behind other views
		You can add a view with Window -> Show View
		
	Current perspective can be customised
		Either a saved perspective or a delivered one
		Window -> Customise Perspective...
			Adjust tool bar and menu visibilities, and command group and shortcut availabilities
		
	Perspectives can be reset to factory defaults


Projects
	The top level construct for organising all resources
		Contains files as well as folders
	
	Different kinds of projects have different structures
		Java project versus JEE project
	
	Plug-ins will often add new types of projects
		EXAMPLE
			JBoss Tools (plug-in) adds Hibernate, Seam
	
	To configure a project's properties, switch to the Project Explorer View, right click on the project's name and select the properties item
	

Java Project
	Contains Java files and JavaBeans
	
	Defines the Java Build Path
		Build path used to compile source files
			Other projects may be included
			JAR files internal or external to a project may be included
		
	Facilitates package and class creation and organisation
	
	Provides a source code editor with syntax highlighting
	
	Compile and debug on a project-by-project bases
	

Java Editor: Code Assist
	When working on a class in the Java Editor, Eclipse can assist your coding in two ways
		If you pause in the middle of writing a class, method name, etc., Eclipse will offer suggestions
		You can request assistance from Eclipse by pressing the keys Ctrl + Space bar
