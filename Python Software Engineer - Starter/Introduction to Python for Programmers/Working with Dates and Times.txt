	variable = datetime(2022, 4, 15)

	strftime()
		all classes in datetime except timedelta implement strftime() for creating a custom time format
		usage similar to legacy string formattingl the "directives", or placeholders start with a % sign
	strptime()
		the %f directive accepts from 1 to 6 digits and 0 pads on the right
		the %p directive only affects the output hour field inf the %l durective is used to parse the hour
		the range is really 0 - 61; this accounts for leap seconds and the (very rare) double leap seconds
		the %U and %W are only used in calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified
			if utcoffset() returns timedetla(hours=-3, minutes=-30), %z is replaced with the strgin '-0330'
