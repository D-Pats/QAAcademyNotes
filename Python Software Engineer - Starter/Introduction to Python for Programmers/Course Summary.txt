Course Summary
	
	Everything in Python is declared by assignment
	
	Python supports Dynamic typing
	
	Variables in Python are declared by assigning to them
	
	A variable cannot be used before it is assigned to
	
	The Python convention for vaiable names is all_lower_case_with_underscores
	
	Python supports three numeric types
		integers
		floating point numbers
		complex numbers
	
	Python supports four tpes of sequences
		strings
		bytes
		lists
		tuples
	
	Python suports two mapping types
		dictionaries
		sets
		
	Dictionaries are mapped sets of values. Dictionary keys must be hashable
	
	Sets are similar to dictionaries but contain only keys. A set is a unique collection of values. There are two types - the normal set is dynamic (mutable), and a frozenset is fixed (immutable)
	
	In Python, modules must be imported before their contents may be accessed. Variables, Functions, and classes must be declared beefore they can be used
	
	There are 3 main IO methods in Python. Print, open, and input
	
	The conditional statement in Python is IF
	
	There are two kinds of loops in Print.
		The WHILE loop is used for reading data, typically from a database or other data source, or when waiting for user input to end a loop
		The FOR loop is used to iterate through a sequence of data
	
	Builtin functions can be applied to many different data types, but not all functions can be applied to all data types
